## Research Focus

Quantitative measurement of AI's distributional economic impacts. Architect of the **Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)** — a live, validated composite index covering 50 countries across four dimensions: Access, Affordability, Language Support, and Skills. Research methodology integrates multi-source international datasets (World Bank, ITU, UNESCO), statistical normalization across heterogeneous national data, and Principal Component Analysis for weight calibration.

## Current Research

**Founder & Lead Researcher — AlmaNEO Research Initiative** | 2025 – Present

- Designed and deployed **GAII v1.0**: composite index measuring AI inequality across 50 countries (6.2B people, 77% of world population)
- Built automated data pipelines integrating World Bank WDI, ITU ICT Statistics, UNESCO Education Data, and AI pricing survey data
- Applied PCA to determine dimension weights; validated against Gini coefficient and HDI benchmarks
- Published open-access GAII Report v1.0 with regional analysis and policy recommendations
- Operates free AI gateway (Gemini + Llama 3.3 70B) serving 14 language communities in the Global South — direct instantiation of the research mission
- Open-source platform: 670+ files, 178,000+ lines of code (CC-BY-4.0)

## Professional Experience

**Chief Executive Officer & CTO — DEANVIL Co., Ltd.** | Seoul, South Korea | Sep 2006 – Dec 2024

Led technology strategy and product development across 18 years, with a focus on data-intensive platform engineering and AI application development:

- **AI Matching Systems**: Built ML-based recommendation platforms (ATOA APP, Edaero APP) using statistical models to match users across multi-dimensional preference datasets — directly analogous to composite index methodology
- **Quantitative Pipeline Development**: Engineered automated data transformation pipelines (3D DATA Auto Converting System), reducing processing time 80% through algorithmic optimization
- **IoT Data Analytics**: Designed real-time data collection and anomaly detection system for smart manufacturing (Mbaro), processing multi-sensor time series data at scale
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Deployed smart contracts and on-chain data systems (NFTsea Marketplace, Kpopclick) on Ethereum/Polygon — now applied to GAII data integrity and open data provenance

**Technical Advisor — EPT Co., Ltd.** | Seoul, South Korea | Sep 2009 – Aug 2011

Strategic consulting on data-driven process optimization for industrial automation.

**R&D Team Leader — MOLDCARE** | Seoul, South Korea | Sep 2002 – Aug 2006

Led software R&D team building algorithmic solutions for geometric data modeling and manufacturing simulation.
