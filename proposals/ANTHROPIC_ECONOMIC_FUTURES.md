## Measuring the Distributional Economic Impact of AI: The Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)

**Principal Investigator:** Ruca Lee, AlmaNEO Research Initiative
**Requested Amount:** $35,000 USD + $5,000 Claude API Credits
**Research Duration:** 6 months
**Submission Date:** February 2026
**Live Research Platform:** https://almaneo.org/gaii

## 1. Research Summary

**Research Question:** How does asymmetric AI adoption create measurable economic stratification across income levels, geographic regions, and linguistic communities — and what quantitative framework can make this stratification visible, trackable, and actionable for policy?

This proposal presents the **Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)** — a validated, live composite measurement framework that quantifies AI inequality across four dimensions: Access (40%), Affordability (30%), Language Support (20%), and Skills (10%). Unlike existing technology adoption indices (ITU ICT Development Index, World Bank Digital Adoption Index), GAII specifically captures the *economic burden* of AI exclusion on developing economies — not just whether connectivity exists, but whether AI tools are practically accessible and economically viable.

**This is not a speculative research project.** GAII v1.0 is already deployed: a live dashboard covering 50 countries, open-access report, and free AI gateway serving users in 14 languages are operational today at almaneo.org. This grant proposal funds the rigorous academic extension of that foundation — expanding coverage to 100 countries, adding temporal tracking, and establishing peer-reviewed economic correlations.

**Key Hypothesis:** AI adoption asymmetry is not merely a technology gap — it is an economic multiplier that accelerates pre-existing income inequality, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where those excluded from AI tools fall further behind in labor markets, education, and economic opportunity.

**Preliminary findings** from our 50-country dataset: AI adoption in the Global North (33.2%) is 3.5× higher than the Global South (9.5%), and AI subscription costs consume 25–28% of monthly income in the poorest countries — effectively excluding billions from the most transformative technology of our era. The grant funds the quantitative research needed to turn this observation into peer-reviewed, policy-actionable evidence.

## 2. Background & Motivation

### 2.1 The AI Adoption Gap

The AI revolution is generating economic value at unprecedented speed. McKinsey estimates AI could add $13 trillion to global GDP by 2030. However, this value creation is geographically concentrated:

| Indicator | Data | Source |
|:----------|:-----|:-------|
| Global GPU concentration | Top 1% of companies own >90% of compute | Stanford AI Index 2025 |
| AI investment concentration | US & China account for >80% of AI startup funding | CB Insights 2025 |
| AI training data language | >90% in English | UNESCO Digital Library |
| AI adoption rate, Global North | 33.2% of population | GAII v1.0 Dataset |
| AI adoption rate, Global South | 9.5% of population | GAII v1.0 Dataset |

### 2.2 Economic Consequences of AI Exclusion

AI exclusion has measurable economic consequences that extend beyond simple access metrics:

1. **Labor Market Displacement**: Workers without AI tools compete against AI-augmented workers in an increasingly global labor market. A Harvard Business School study found AI-assisted consultants performed 40% better than their unassisted peers.

2. **Educational Inequality**: Students in AI-rich environments develop skills that are 2-3x more productive in knowledge economy tasks, creating divergent human capital trajectories.

3. **Entrepreneurial Barriers**: AI access reduces startup costs by 30-60% (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023), meaning entrepreneurs in AI-poor regions face higher barriers to entry.

4. **Wage Premium**: OECD data shows a growing "AI wage premium" — workers proficient in AI tools earn 15-25% more than comparable workers without AI skills.

### 2.3 Why Existing Metrics Fall Short

Current technology indices (ITU ICT Development Index, World Bank Digital Adoption Index) measure internet access and digital infrastructure but fail to capture AI-specific inequalities:

- They don't measure **AI cost burden** relative to income
- They don't capture **language barriers** specific to AI tools
- They don't assess **AI literacy** as distinct from general digital literacy
- They don't differentiate between **consumer AI** and **productive AI** access

GAII addresses these gaps with a purpose-built measurement framework.

## 3. Research Design & Methodology

### 3.1 GAII Composite Index Formula

```
GAII = 100 - (0.4 × Access + 0.3 × Affordability + 0.2 × Language + 0.1 × Skill)
```

Where:
- **GAII = 0**: Perfect AI equality (universal access)
- **GAII = 100**: Extreme AI inequality (no access)

### 3.2 Indicator Framework

#### Access (Weight: 40%)
Measures the availability and quality of AI services.

| Sub-indicator | Weight | Data Source | Calculation |
|:-------------|:------:|:-----------|:------------|
| AI Adoption Rate | 0.40 | Microsoft Global AI Report | Normalized to 65% ceiling |
| Internet Penetration | 0.30 | ITU ICT Statistics | Direct percentage |
| Mobile Connectivity | 0.15 | ITU Mobile Data | Direct percentage |
| Infrastructure Quality | 0.15 | World Bank | Composite infrastructure score |

#### Affordability (Weight: 30%)
Measures the economic burden of AI services.

| Sub-indicator | Weight | Data Source | Calculation |
|:-------------|:------:|:-----------|:------------|
| AI Cost-to-Income Ratio | 0.50 | World Bank + AI pricing data | Inverted: 0% = 100, 30% = 0 |
| Free Service Accessibility | 0.25 | Primary research | Survey-based (0-100) |
| Purchasing Power | 0.25 | World Bank PPP data | Normalized to 0-100 |

#### Language (Weight: 20%)
Measures AI's ability to serve speakers of local languages.

| Sub-indicator | Weight | Data Source | Calculation |
|:-------------|:------:|:-----------|:------------|
| Native Language Support | 0.50 | Primary research | Quality assessment (0-100) |
| Translation Quality | 0.30 | Benchmark evaluations | Automated scoring (0-100) |
| Local Content Availability | 0.20 | Web content analysis | Coverage assessment (0-100) |

#### Skill (Weight: 10%)
Measures population readiness to use AI productively.

| Sub-indicator | Weight | Data Source | Calculation |
|:-------------|:------:|:-----------|:------------|
| AI Literacy | 0.40 | UNESCO + primary surveys | Composite score (0-100) |
| STEM Education | 0.30 | UNESCO Education Data | Enrollment-based (0-100) |
| Digital Skills | 0.30 | ITU Digital Skills Index | Direct score (0-100) |

### 3.3 Weighting Rationale

Weights were determined through a combination of:
1. **Expert consultation**: 12 interviews with AI policy researchers
2. **Statistical analysis**: Principal Component Analysis of preliminary data
3. **Sensitivity testing**: Results remain robust under ±10% weight variations

Access receives the highest weight (40%) because physical availability is a prerequisite for all other dimensions. Affordability (30%) captures the largest single barrier identified in our preliminary research. Language (20%) reflects the growing importance of linguistic accessibility as AI becomes more conversational. Skill (10%) is weighted lowest because it is partially dependent on the other three factors.

### 3.4 Proposed Research Extensions (With Grant Funding)

| Extension | Current State | Target | Method |
|:----------|:-------------|:-------|:-------|
| Country coverage | 50 countries | 100 countries | Secondary data + Claude API analysis |
| Temporal dimension | Single snapshot | Quarterly tracking | Automated data pipelines |
| Economic correlation | None | GDP, employment, Gini coefficient | Regression analysis |
| Policy analysis | None | AI policy documents in 20 languages | Claude API NLP analysis |
| Survey component | None | 1,000 respondents across 10 countries | Online + field surveys |

## 4. Preliminary Findings (GAII Report v1.0)

### 4.1 Global Overview

Our initial dataset covers 50 countries representing approximately 6.2 billion people (77% of world population).

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Population-weighted Global GAII | ~53 (Moderate-High inequality) |
| Countries tracked | 50 |
| Population covered | ~6.2 billion |
| Global North AI adoption | 33.2% |
| Global South AI adoption | 9.5% |
| North-South adoption ratio | 3.5:1 |

### 4.2 Regional Analysis

| Region | Avg GAII | Key Finding |
|:-------|:--------:|:-----------|
| North America | ~18 | High adoption, cost barriers for lower income |
| Europe | ~24 | Strong infrastructure, variable AI literacy |
| East Asia | ~22 | Singapore, Korea lead; infrastructure quality highest |
| Oceania | ~20 | Near-universal access in Australia, New Zealand |
| Latin America | ~48 | Spanish language support helps; infrastructure gaps |
| Middle East | ~46 | Polarized: UAE leading vs. conflict zones lagging |
| Southeast Asia | ~50 | Singapore as hub; rapid growth potential |
| Central Asia | ~56 | Moderate development; growing digital investment |
| South Asia | ~66 | Major affordability crisis (AI = 25-28% of income) |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | ~74 | Critical gaps in all four dimensions |

### 4.3 Key Economic Insights

1. **Affordability as the Primary Barrier**: The strongest single predictor of high GAII is the AI cost-to-income ratio. In Bangladesh, a standard AI subscription ($20/month) equals 28% of average monthly income.

2. **Language Exclusion at Scale**: Over 3 billion people speak languages where AI support quality averages below 40/100. This is not just inconvenience — it is economic exclusion from AI-augmented productivity.

3. **The 3.5x Gap**: AI adoption in the Global North is 3.5x higher than the Global South. If this ratio persists, the resulting productivity gap will compound at approximately 15-20% annually.

4. **Infrastructure vs. Affordability**: Countries with adequate internet infrastructure but poor affordability scores (e.g., India, Indonesia) represent the most actionable intervention targets.

## 5. Alignment with Anthropic Economic Futures Program

This research directly addresses several pillars of the Anthropic Economic Futures agenda:

### 5.1 Distributional Consequences of AI

GAII provides the first systematic, multi-dimensional measurement of how AI's economic benefits are distributed globally. Unlike binary access metrics, GAII captures the nuanced reality that "AI access" without affordability, language support, or skills training is effectively meaningless.

### 5.2 Labor Market Transitions

Our planned correlation analysis (GAII vs. employment data) will illuminate how AI inequality maps onto labor market outcomes — specifically whether high-GAII countries experience slower wage growth and higher displacement vulnerability.

### 5.3 AI for Economic Development

By identifying specific barriers (access, cost, language, skills) in specific regions, GAII provides actionable intelligence for policy interventions. This transforms the abstract concern of "AI inequality" into a concrete, measurable, and addressable problem.

### 5.4 Building on Anthropic's Economic Research

This research complements Anthropic's existing work on AI's macroeconomic impacts by providing the **microeconomic and geographic** granularity needed for policy formation. We anticipate that cross-referencing GAII data with Anthropic's research on AI productivity could yield novel insights about the relationship between AI access inequality and productivity divergence.
