## 1. Executive Summary

### In the AI Era, Who Owns Intelligence?

In 2024, humanity acquired the most powerful tool in history. AI writes, codes, diagnoses medical conditions, and interprets laws. The gap between those who have these tools and those who do not is widening faster and deeper than any previous technological revolution.

**AlmaNEO was born to answer this question.**

> *"We plant warm affection on cold code."*
>
> We don't compete with Big Tech. We exchange their surplus resources for **ethical data**, redistributing them to the marginalized 8 billion people worldwide—building an **ecosystem of coexistence**.

### Core Value Proposition

| Category | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| **Strategic Hybrid DePIN** | An Aggregator model that sources and distributes Big Tech resources instead of competing in hardware mining |
| **The Kindness Leverage** | Providing 'bias-free ethical data (Clean RLHF)' that AI companies desperately need, in exchange for AI computing power |
| **Polygon-Powered** | Processing all value exchanges and verifications transparently on Polygon's scalability (zkEVM) |

## 2. Problem Statement: Invisible Barriers

### 2.1 AI Inequality: 21st Century Digital Colonialism

Just as the previous industrial revolution brought about inequality in physical labor, the AI revolution is creating **inequality in 'thinking and intelligence'**.

**Real-World Numbers:**

| Indicator | Current Status |
|:---|:---|
| AI Computational Resource Concentration | Top 1% of companies own over 90% of global GPUs |
| AI Service Costs | $20/month (Developed country youth: 4 cups of coffee / Global South youth: 10-30% of monthly living expenses) |
| AI Startup Investment | US and China account for over 80% of global investment |
| Language Bias | More than 90% of major AI model training data is in English |

Universities in developed countries use AI to complete assignments, learn coding, and test startup ideas. At the same time, college students in developing countries are labeling the data needed to build that AI for a few dollars an hour.

**This is the true face of 21st-century digital colonialism.**

### 2.2 Monetization of Intelligence: The Collapsing Ladder of Opportunity

Education was a ladder of social mobility. Society was sustained by the belief that even children from poor families could achieve a better life if they studied hard.

But now, that ladder is shaky.

**Scenario: A Day in the Life of Two Young People**

| Time | 🇺🇸 Developed Country Youth A | 🌍 Global South Youth B |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Morning** | Editing resume with ChatGPT | Exceeding daily limit on free version AI |
| **Afternoon** | Completing coding project with Copilot | Only basic searches possible with slow internet |
| **Evening** | Learning a new language with an AI tutor | Starting a side hustle as a data labeler for an AI company |

How much wider will the competitiveness gap between the two young people be in a year?
Will this gap be recoverable in five years?

> **"The moment intelligence becomes monetized, equality of opportunity becomes a myth."**

### 2.3 The Core Chain of Problems

```
1. Capital monopolizes intelligence.
2. Inequality of intelligence leads to inequality of opportunity.
3. Inequality of opportunity leads to loss of hope.
4. As the number of young people who lose hope increases, the future of the planet becomes bleak.
```

**AlmaNEO was born to break this chain.**

## 3. Our Philosophy: Jeong (情)

### 3.1 Jeong (情): From Korea to the World

In Korea, there is a word called **"Jeong (情)"**.

Jeong is not simply kindness. It is a deep bond built over time, a heart that connects without words, and a warmth that cannot be ignored even when loss occurs. Jeong cannot be explained by efficiency. It cannot be measured by calculations. However, a relationship based on Jeong is stronger than any contract.

AI seeks to optimize everything: faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. However, Jeong is not an object of optimization. Jeong takes time. Jeong is sometimes inefficient. Therefore, Jeong is a **uniquely human value that AI cannot replace**.

**AlmaNEO embodies this value of "Jeong" in the digital world.**

### 3.2 Three Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| **People, Not Politics** | We don't look at countries. We look at people. A young person in Nigeria, a young person in Vietnam, a young person in Brazil—they all deserve the same dream. |
| **Individuals, Not Countries** | The grand system sees individuals as numbers. GDP, unemployment rates, growth rates—the lives of individuals are invisible in these statistics. AlmaNEO sees individuals, not statistics. |
| **Technology is a Tool, Humans are the Subject** | No matter how advanced AI becomes, the final decision must be made by humans. Technology should not dominate humans, but humans should be the subjects of technology. |

### 3.3 A World Where Kindness Becomes Value

In the current economic system, kindness is not rewarded. You could earn money by helping someone. You could monopolize knowledge instead of sharing it. Kind people often lose out.

**AlmaNEO turns this equation on its head.**

| Existing System | AlmaNEO System |
|:---|:---|
| Monopoly → Profit | Sharing → Kindness Score increases → More opportunities |
| Competition → Success | Solidarity → Trust asset accumulation → Increased influence in ecosystem |
| Kindness → Loss | Kindness → On-chain record → Real rewards |

---

## 4. Solution: The Ethical Bridge

AlmaNEO does not define AI companies as enemies. Instead, we invite them to participate as **'Resource Providers'** in the ecosystem.

### 4.1 GAII Dashboard (The Moral Lever)

> *"Problems that are not measured cannot be solved."*

- **Function**: Ranks and publicly displays not only country-level AI inequality indices but also global AI companies' **'AI Inclusivity Scores'** in real-time.
- **Strategic Effect**: This metric acts as an **ESG standard**, creating **moral leverage** that incentivizes companies to donate or supply resources cheaply to the AlmaNEO ecosystem for image enhancement.
- **Current Status**: GAII data collection for 50 countries complete, Report v1.0 ready for publication

### 4.2 AlmaNEO AI Hub (Relay DePIN)

> *"Don't compete—connect."*

Our DePIN focuses on **'exchange and distribution'** rather than 'production'.

**Exchange Mechanism (The Great Exchange):**

| AlmaNEO Provides | Big Tech Provides |
|:---|:---|
| **Diversity data** generated by users across 14 language regions | High-performance GPU cloud during idle hours |
| **Ethical feedback (RLHF)** - Key to solving AI bias | API access and credits |

**Redistribution:**
AI Hub prioritizes supplying acquired computing power to **'verified kind talent (Kindness SBT holders)'** at low cost (or free).

### 4.3 Kindness Protocol (Proof of Humanity)

> *"In the AI era, the scarcest resource is 'humanity'."*

- **Jeong-SBT (Soulbound Token)**: Permanently records users' good deeds, contributions, and data provision activities on the blockchain. A **'certificate of humanity'** that bots cannot imitate.
- **Ambassador SBT**: A 4-tier system automatically issued based on offline activities such as meetup attendance, hosting, and mentoring
- **Kindness Game**: Users naturally participate in AI training data labeling or feedback while enjoying games. This labor is recognized as 'mining' and rewarded with **ALMAN tokens**.

## 5. Why Polygon?

Realizing AlmaNEO's hybrid strategy requires both **'speed'** and **'trust'** simultaneously.

| Requirement | Polygon's Strength |
|:---|:---|
| **Micro-Transaction** | High TPS and low gas fees for real-time reward processing of RLHF data (Micro-Tasks) from millions of users |
| **Data Verification** | Mathematical transparency guaranteed by Polygon zkEVM |
| **Cross-chain Connection** | Integration of fragmented liquidity and resources through AggLayer |
| **Mass Adoption** | Track record of collaboration with major companies like Starbucks and Nike. Optimal for our 'corporate cooperation model' |

## 6. Differentiation: Why We Are Different

### Existing DePIN vs AlmaNEO

| Category | Existing DePIN (io.net, Render, Akash) | AlmaNEO |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Approach** | Aggregate GPU resources to compete with Big Tech | Exchange RLHF data for Big Tech resources |
| **Result** | Inevitable defeat in economies of scale | Cooperation model, Win-Win |
| **Target Customer** | Enterprises, Developers | **Low-income youth (8 billion people)** |
| **Core Asset** | Hardware (GPU) | Software + Ethics (Data) |
| **Mission** | Distributed Computing | **AI Democratization** |

### Key Difference

```
❌ Existing DePIN: "Aggregate GPU resources to compete with Big Tech"
   → Inevitable defeat in economies of scale

✅ AlmaNEO: "Exchange RLHF data, a unique asset, for Big Tech resources"
   → Cooperation model, Win-Win
   → Competing on 'value', not technology
```
