- Data validation and cross-checking by country-level research contributors — 50 countries × 4 hours × $20/hr ($4,000)
- AI pricing survey data collection (primary research): current AI subscription costs, purchasing power parity adjustments, and free service accessibility in 50 new markets ($4,000)

### 2. Research Assistant — $10,000

Part-time research support for 6 months:
- Literature review and citation management for peer-reviewed output
- Survey instrument design and validation (Months 2–3)

## Budget Notes

- All estimates are good-faith approximations consistent with independent research norms
- Research assistant compensation reflects Global South-based hiring (sustainable rate for the region)
- Survey incentives calibrated to local purchasing power — not Western rates
- No overhead or institutional indirect costs applied (independent initiative)
- Any underspend will be applied to extend dataset coverage or additional survey rounds
