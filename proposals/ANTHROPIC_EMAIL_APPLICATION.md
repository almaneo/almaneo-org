Dear Anthropic Economic Futures Team,

I am applying for the Anthropic Economic Futures Research Award. I attempted to submit via the Google Form but encountered a persistent 400 error on submission, so I am submitting my complete application by email. All required documents are attached.

**Applicant**
- Name: Intae Lee (Ruca Lee)
- Email: ruca@almaneo.org
- Organization: AlmaNEO Research Initiative
- Position: Principal Investigator & Lead Researcher
- Country: South Korea

**Project**
- Title: Global AI Inequality Index (GAII): Measuring AI's Distributional Economic Impact Across 100 Countries
- Live Platform: https://almaneo.org/gaii
- Research Topics: AI democratization & economic inequality / Labor market impacts / AI productivity & economic growth
- Requested: $35,000 USD + $5,000 Claude API Credits
- Duration: 6 months (March – August 2026)

**Existing Datasets**
World Bank WDI, ITU ICT Statistics, UNESCO UIS, ILO ILOSTAT, WIID (Gini)

**Research Team**
- Ruca Lee — Principal Investigator (full-time)
- 1 Part-time Research Assistant (Global South-based, 6 months)

**Planned Claude API Usage ($5,000)**
1. Multilingual policy analysis — AI policy documents in 20 languages: $1,500
2. Data cross-validation — GAII indicators across 100 countries: $1,000
3. Survey response processing — 1,000 survey responses: $500
4. Report localization — GAII Report v2.0 in 10 languages: $1,000
5. Literature review and methodology refinement: $1,000

**Relationship to Anthropic Economic Index**
The AEI documents AI's occupation-level impacts *within* high-adoption economies. GAII documents the *absence* of those impacts in low-adoption economies. Cross-referencing the two datasets will test whether AEI-documented productivity gains correlate with widening GAII disparities.

**Co-investigators:** None (independent research initiative)
**Project website:** https://almaneo.org/gaii

I confirm all information is accurate and I agree to the terms and conditions of the program.
