## 1. Project Vision

AI inequality is a democratic crisis.

When 3.5 billion people cannot access the AI tools that are rapidly reshaping labor markets, education systems, and civic participation, we are not witnessing a technology gap — we are witnessing a democratic deficit. The promises of "AI for all" ring hollow when a ChatGPT subscription costs 30% of monthly income in sub-Saharan Africa, when 90% of AI training data is in English, and when the computational resources powering modern AI are concentrated in the hands of fewer than a dozen corporations.

AlmaNEO is a civic technology platform that addresses this crisis through three interconnected strategies:

1. **Transparent Measurement (GAII):** A publicly accessible index that quantifies AI inequality across 50 countries, providing the evidence base that policymakers, journalists, and civil society need to demand accountability.
2. **Democratic Access (AI Hub):** A free, multilingual AI gateway serving 14 languages — including Swahili, Khmer, Indonesian, and Vietnamese — so that language and income are no longer barriers to participation in the AI era.
3. **Community Governance (Kindness Protocol):** A governance model where decision-making power is earned not through financial investment, but through demonstrated commitment to community — hosting meetups, mentoring newcomers, translating resources, and building local capacity.

Our philosophy is captured in a single phrase: **"Cold Code, Warm Soul"** — the belief that technology must serve human connection, and that the Korean concept of *Jeong* (deep emotional bonds between people) should guide how we build digital infrastructure.

## 2. How We Address Mozilla's Three Democratic Challenges

### 2.1 Information Fidelity

The dominant narrative around AI is shaped by the companies building it. Claims of "democratized AI" and "AI for everyone" persist unchallenged because there is no standardized, transparent way to measure who actually benefits from AI and who is left behind.

**The Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)** fills this gap:

- **50 countries measured** across four weighted indicators:
  - **Access (40%):** AI service adoption rates, internet penetration, mobile connectivity, infrastructure quality
  - **Affordability (30%):** AI subscription costs relative to income, availability of free alternatives, purchasing power
  - **Language (20%):** Local language AI quality, translation accuracy, content availability in non-English languages
  - **Skill (10%):** AI literacy rates, STEM education levels, digital competency
- **Open methodology:** GAII = 100 - (0.4 x Access + 0.3 x Affordability + 0.2 x Language + 0.1 x Skill)
- **Open data:** All datasets published under CC-BY-4.0, methodology fully documented
- **Interactive dashboard:** Live at almaneo.org/gaii with world map visualization, country comparisons, and regional analysis
- **PDF reports:** Downloadable GAII Report v1.0 with executive summary, rankings, and policy recommendations

GAII provides the hard evidence that counters vague corporate claims about AI inclusion. When a company says "our AI serves the world," GAII can show exactly which parts of the world are being served — and which are not.

**Data sources:** Microsoft Global AI Adoption Report 2025, World Bank Development Indicators, ITU ICT Statistics, UNESCO Education Data.

### 2.2 Institutional Trust

Trust in institutions erodes when decisions are made behind closed doors by unaccountable actors. In the AI ecosystem, this manifests as opaque model training decisions, unexplained content moderation policies, and corporate governance structures that exclude the communities most affected by AI.

**The Kindness Protocol** offers an alternative governance model:

- **Participation-based authority:** Governance rights are earned through verified real-world activities — not purchased. Hosting a community meetup, mentoring a newcomer, translating platform resources into a local language, or leading an educational workshop all contribute to a participant's governance standing.
- **Ambassador system:** Community leaders progress through four tiers based on demonstrated contribution:
  - *Kindness Friend* — Attended first community meetup
  - *Kindness Host* — Hosted 3+ community events
  - *Kindness Ambassador* — Earned 500+ community points through sustained contribution
  - *Kindness Guardian* — Earned 1,000+ points and mentored 10+ new participants
- **Transparent decision-making:** All governance votes and their outcomes are publicly recorded and auditable. Community members can see exactly how decisions were made and who participated.
- **14 language communities:** Governance is multilingual by design. Community discussions, proposals, and votes are accessible in Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, Malay, Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, and Swahili.

This is democratic governance in practice: authority flows from contribution, not capital.

### 2.3 Civic Activation

Democratic participation requires access to information, the ability to communicate, and the opportunity to organize. AI is rapidly becoming essential infrastructure for all three — yet billions of people are excluded from it.

**AlmaNEO activates civic participation through:**

- **AI Hub:** Free multilingual AI access (14 languages) removes the information barrier. A farmer in Kenya, a student in Cambodia, and a community organizer in Vietnam can all access the same quality of AI assistance — in their own language, at no cost.
  - Multi-model gateway: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite + Meta Llama 3.3 70B (via Groq)
  - 50 free queries per day per user
  - No credit card, no subscription — just a social login

- **Offline meetup network:** The Kindness Protocol incentivizes real-world community building. Hosting a meetup earns 80 points; attending earns 30; a first-time participant receives a 50-point bonus. These are not abstract digital rewards — they represent a community's recognition that showing up matters.

- **Global South focus:** AlmaNEO deliberately prioritizes the communities most excluded from AI's benefits. Our 14 supported languages include four Southeast Asian languages (Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Khmer), Swahili (East Africa), and Arabic (Middle East/North Africa). Our GAII data covers regions that mainstream AI indices ignore entirely.

- **World Culture Travel Game:** An educational game (game.almaneo.org) with 58 quests across 20 countries that builds cultural understanding and AI literacy simultaneously. Available in Korean and English, with more languages planned.

## 3. The Kindness Protocol: Democratic Governance in Practice

The Kindness Protocol is AlmaNEO's answer to a fundamental question: **How do you build governance systems that reward contribution over capital?**

### 3.1 The Problem with Existing Models

Most digital governance systems — whether corporate boards, online platform moderation, or even many open-source projects — default to one of two models:
- **Plutocratic:** Power scales with financial investment (shareholder voting, token-weighted governance)
- **Technocratic:** Power concentrates among early contributors or technical experts

Both models systematically exclude the communities that AlmaNEO serves. A community organizer in rural Vietnam who has built local AI literacy programs has no voice in a plutocratic system. A grandmother in Kenya who hosts weekly neighborhood meetups has no standing in a technocratic one.

### 3.2 Participation-Based Governance

The Kindness Protocol distributes governance authority based on verified community participation:

| Activity | Points | Verification |
|:---------|-------:|:-------------|
| First meetup attendance | +50 | Photo + participant tagging |
| Meetup attendance | +30 | Photo + participant tagging |
| Meetup hosting | +80 | 3+ attendees confirmed |
| Large meetup hosting (10+) | +120 | Photo + attendee list |
| New user onboarding | +30 | Mentor confirmation |
| 1:1 mentoring session | +40 | Both parties confirm |
| Educational content creation | +50 | Community review |
| Workshop/seminar facilitation | +100 | Attendance verification |
| Translation contribution | +20 | Quality review |
| Regional community leadership | +50/month | Activity metrics |
| New language community launch | +100 | Minimum 10 members |
| Volunteer service | +40 | Photo documentation |
| Governance vote participation | +10 | Verified participation |

### 3.3 Ambassador Tiers

As participants accumulate verified contributions, they progress through four Ambassador tiers:

| Tier | Requirements | Governance Rights |
|:-----|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Kindness Friend** | First meetup attendance | Can vote on community proposals |
| **Kindness Host** | 3+ meetups hosted | Can submit community proposals |
| **Kindness Ambassador** | 500+ points | Can nominate other Ambassadors; weighted vote |
| **Kindness Guardian** | 1,000+ points + 10 mentees | Can propose policy changes; veto power on community safety issues |

Each tier is represented by a non-transferable digital credential (Ambassador SBT) that is permanently linked to the participant's verified identity. These credentials cannot be bought, sold, or transferred — they can only be earned.

### 3.4 Verification Model

The verification system evolves with the community:
- **Phase 1 (Current):** Team-verified submissions with photo documentation
- **Phase 2 (6-12 months):** Hybrid model with automated checks and community review
- **Phase 3 (12+ months):** Full community governance with elected verification committees

## 11. Why Mozilla

Mozilla's mission — keeping the internet open, accessible, and democratic — is the foundation on which AlmaNEO is built.

The Democracy x AI Incubator asks: *How do we ensure AI strengthens rather than undermines democratic society?* AlmaNEO provides a concrete, operational answer:

1. **Measurement creates accountability.** GAII transforms vague concerns about AI inequality into specific, comparable, actionable data. You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Mozilla has long championed transparency — GAII extends that principle to the AI era.

2. **Access enables participation.** The AI Hub removes the economic and linguistic barriers that prevent billions of people from participating in the AI-mediated future. Mozilla's commitment to an internet that works for everyone aligns directly with our commitment to AI that works for everyone.

3. **Community governance builds trust.** The Kindness Protocol demonstrates that governance systems can be both effective and inclusive — that you don't need to choose between participation and competence. Mozilla's model of open-source community governance is the direct inspiration for our approach.

4. **We are already doing the work.** AlmaNEO is not a proposal for future work — it is a request to scale work that is already operational. The platform is live, the code is open, the communities are forming. Mozilla's support would accelerate what is already happening.

We believe that AI inequality is the defining democratic challenge of our generation. We believe that the communities most affected by this inequality should lead the response. And we believe that Mozilla is the right partner to help us build that future.
