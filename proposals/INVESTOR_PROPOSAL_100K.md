## Key Terms

> This memorandum includes terminology from the investment and blockchain sectors. The reference tables below will help you navigate the document with confidence.

### Investment Terms

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **SAFE** | Simple Agreement for Future Equity — an early-stage investment contract that converts into equity when the company raises a priced round. It allows quick investment without complex stock issuance. |
| **Token Warrant** | A contractual right to receive tokens at a predetermined price when they become available. Combined with a SAFE, it gives the investor both equity and token upside. |
| **Pre-Seed** | The earliest stage of startup investment, typically before or shortly after product launch. Carries the highest risk but also the highest potential return. |
| **FDV** | Fully Diluted Valuation — the total market capitalization assuming all tokens are in circulation. Calculated as: token price × total supply. |
| **Pre-money** | The company's valuation before the investment is added. This figure determines what percentage of the company the investor receives. |
| **Valuation Cap** | The maximum company valuation at which a SAFE converts to equity. Even if the company grows beyond this cap, the investor converts at this ceiling — rewarding early risk. |
| **Pro-rata Rights** | The right to invest in future funding rounds on equal terms, preserving the investor's ownership percentage as the company raises additional capital. |
| **ROI** | Return on Investment — the ratio of profit to the amount invested, expressed as a multiple (e.g., 10x means a $100K investment returned $1M). |
| **Runway** | The number of months a company can operate with its current funds before needing additional capital. "6-month runway" means 6 months of operations are funded. |
| **Non-dilutive** | Funding that does not reduce existing investors' ownership. Grants are the primary example — capital received without giving up equity. |

### Blockchain & Token Terms

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **TGE** | Token Generation Event — the moment tokens are first created (minted) on the blockchain. Analogous to an IPO in traditional finance. |
| **DEX** | Decentralized Exchange — a platform where users trade tokens directly with each other, without a central intermediary. (e.g., QuickSwap, Uniswap) |
| **CEX** | Centralized Exchange — a company-operated exchange. (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Upbit) |
| **Smart Contract** | A self-executing program stored on the blockchain. When predefined conditions are met, the contract executes automatically without intermediaries. |
| **UUPS Proxy** | A smart contract design pattern that allows safe upgrades after deployment, ensuring long-term operational flexibility without redeploying. |
| **ERC-20** | The standard token specification on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. ALMAN follows this standard, ensuring compatibility with virtually all wallets and exchanges. |
| **SBT** | Soulbound Token — a non-transferable digital credential permanently tied to a specific person, like a diploma or professional certification on the blockchain. |
| **DAO** | Decentralized Autonomous Organization — a governance structure where token holders vote on decisions collectively, without centralized management. |
| **Staking** | Locking tokens in a contract for a set period to earn rewards. Similar to a fixed deposit at a bank, but with higher yields from supporting the blockchain ecosystem. |
| **APY** | Annual Percentage Yield — the annualized rate of return on staked tokens, accounting for compounding. |
| **Mainnet** | The live, production blockchain network where real assets are transacted. AlmaNEO is currently on testnet (practice environment); mainnet launch is the next key milestone. |
| **Liquidity Pool (LP)** | A pool of paired tokens deposited into a DEX to enable trading. AlmaNEO will establish an ALMAN/USDC pool on QuickSwap. |
| **Merkle Proof** | A cryptographic method for efficiently verifying that a specific entry exists within a large dataset. Used to confirm airdrop eligibility. |

### Vesting & Token Economics

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **Cliff** | The initial waiting period before any tokens are released. A "6-month cliff" means no tokens can be sold for the first 6 months after investment. |
| **Linear Vesting** | After the cliff, tokens are released in equal monthly installments. "2-year linear" means tokens unlock evenly over 24 months. |
| **Halving** | A mechanism where new token distribution is cut in half at regular intervals. Originated with Bitcoin; creates increasing scarcity over time. |
| **Buy Pressure** | Upward price force created by demand to purchase tokens. When a service requires tokens for access, natural buy pressure forms. |
| **Deflationary** | A token model where circulating supply decreases over time. Achieved by "burning" (permanently removing) a portion of transaction fees. |
| **Burn** | Permanently removing tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible address. |

### Other Terms

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **ESG** | Environmental, Social, and Governance — a framework for evaluating corporate responsibility, increasingly central to global investment decisions. |
| **Moat** | A structural competitive advantage that is difficult for competitors to replicate. Originally refers to the defensive water channel around a castle. |
| **DePIN** | Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network — a blockchain model that connects privately owned hardware (GPUs, storage) to build distributed infrastructure. |
| **QF Matching** | Quadratic Funding — a democratic public goods funding mechanism that allocates matching funds based on the number of individual contributors, not just total amount donated. |

## 1. Executive Summary

The AI industry is projected to reach $4.4 trillion by 2030, yet there is no standardized measure of who benefits from it and who does not. AlmaNEO has built that measure — the **Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)** — tracking 50 countries across four indicators, and uses it as leverage to secure free AI compute from major providers. The result is a flywheel: free AI access attracts underserved users, their usage generates valuable multilingual data, and that data creates partnerships with AI companies seeking ESG credibility.

Today, AlmaNEO is already live with **three deployed products**, **nine verified smart contracts**, and **11 AI models from seven providers** — all built by a three-person team with zero external funding.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|:------|
| Lines of Code | 178,000+ |
| Live Products | 3 (Web, Game, NFT Marketplace) |
| Smart Contracts | 9 UUPS Proxy (upgradeable design) (8 verified on PolygonScan) |
| AI Models | 11 models, 7 providers (via Vercel AI Gateway) |
| Languages Supported | 14 |
| Countries Tracked (GAII) | 50+ |
| Token Supply | 8,000,000,000 ALMAN (minted, on-chain) |
| External Funding to Date | $0 |
| Estimated Rebuild Cost | $500,000 – $800,000 |

### The Ask

**$100,000** via SAFE + Token Warrant for **2.5% equity equivalent** (200,000,000 ALMAN at $0.0005/token), at a pre-money (pre-investment) valuation of **$4M FDV**. Funds will be used for security audit, initial DEX (decentralized exchange) liquidity, team runway (6 months of operating capital), and mainnet (production network) launch.

## 2. The Opportunity — Why Now

### Market Size

The global AI market is projected to reach **$4.4 trillion by 2030** (McKinsey, 2024). Within that market, the "AI access gap" represents **3.5 billion people** who cannot afford $20/month AI subscriptions — the entire population of the Global South.

This is not a niche. It is the majority of humanity.

### The Measurement Gap

Despite growing awareness of AI inequality, **no standardized index exists** to measure it. The World Bank tracks poverty. Freedom House tracks democracy. MSCI tracks ESG. But nobody measures who has access to AI and who does not.

AlmaNEO's GAII fills this void. It is a structured, multi-indicator index with a transparent formula:

```
GAII = 100 - (0.4 × Access + 0.3 × Affordability + 0.2 × Language + 0.1 × Skill)
```

Higher scores indicate greater inequality. The formula weights four dimensions:
- **Access (40%)**: AI adoption rate, internet penetration, infrastructure quality
- **Affordability (30%)**: AI cost-to-income ratio, free service availability
- **Language (20%)**: Local language AI support, translation quality
- **Skill (10%)**: AI literacy, STEM education levels

### Regulatory Tailwind

The EU AI Act (effective 2026) introduces mandatory transparency and fairness requirements. US executive orders on AI equity are increasing corporate demand for ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) inclusion metrics. Companies operating AI services globally will soon need data proving equitable access — exactly what GAII provides.

### Comparable Valuations

| Company/Protocol | What They Index | Valuation | Revenue Multiple |
|:-----------------|:----------------|:----------|:-----------------|
| MSCI | ESG Ratings | $40B+ | 25-30x revenue |
| S&P Global | Credit Ratings | $120B+ | 20-25x revenue |
| Worldcoin | Identity for All | $3B (at launch) | Pre-revenue |
| Helium | Decentralized Infrastructure | $1B+ | Pre-revenue |
| **AlmaNEO** | **AI Inequality Index** | **$4M (pre-money)** | **Pre-revenue** |

At a $4M valuation, an investor enters at a fraction of what comparable data and index businesses command — and at a fraction of what has already been built.

---

### Implied Asset Value

At market rates for a full-stack team (AI + blockchain + frontend + i18n), the existing codebase represents **$500,000–$800,000** in development cost:

| Component | Estimated Cost |
|:----------|:---------------|
| AI Hub (11 models, Gateway architecture) | $80K–$120K |
| 9 Smart Contracts (UUPS, tested, deployed) | $100K–$150K |
| Web Platform (13 sections, 14 languages) | $120K–$180K |
| Game (20 countries, 58 quests, Supabase) | $80K–$120K |
| NFT Marketplace (gasless, rental) | $60K–$100K |
| GAII Data & Reports (50 countries, PDF) | $40K–$60K |
| i18n (14 languages × 3 products) | $30K–$50K |
| **Total** | **$510K–$780K** |

An investor at $100K is entering at **13–20 cents per dollar of existing asset value** — before accounting for the network effects, data, and partnerships that are yet to come.

## 4. Business Model & Revenue Streams

AlmaNEO generates revenue through five streams. Social impact is not the goal — it is the **growth engine**. Free access attracts users. Users generate data. Data creates partnerships. Partnerships generate revenue.

### Revenue Model

| Stream | Model | Launch | Year 2 Target |
|:-------|:------|:-------|:---------------|
| **GAII Reports & Licensing** | B2B subscription for AI companies needing ESG/inclusion data | Q2 2026 | $50K–$200K |
| **AI Hub Premium** | ALMAN token payment for premium models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro) | Q3 2026 | $100K–$500K |
| **Partnership Revenue** | AI companies provide API credits in exchange for GAII data and ethical certification | Q2 2026 | $200K–$1M (in-kind + cash) |
| **NFT Marketplace Fees** | 2.5% transaction fee on NFT trades, SBT minting | Q4 2026 | $10K–$50K |
| **Kindness Expo Sponsorships** | Annual conference sponsorships and ticket sales | Q4 2026 | $50K–$200K |

### The Flywheel

| Step | Input | Output |
|:-----|:------|:-------|
| 1 | Free AI Access | Global South user acquisition |
| 2 | User activity | Multilingual usage data |
| 3 | Data | GAII Reports + ESG metrics |
| 4 | Reports | AI company partnerships |
| 5 | Partnerships | Free API credits + revenue |
| 6 | Credits | → Back to Step 1 (more free AI → more users) |

### Three-Year Financial Projection

| | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) |
|:--|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| **Revenue** | $0–$50K | $200K–$1M | $1M–$5M |
| **Operating Costs** | $120K | $300K | $800K |
| **Net** | -$70K to -$120K | -$100K to +$700K | +$200K to +$4.2M |
| **Team Size** | 3 | 5–7 | 10–15 |
| **AI Hub Users** | 1K–5K | 10K–50K | 100K–500K |
| **GAII Countries** | 100 | 150 | 200+ |

**Note:** Year 1 is a build-and-launch year. The $100K investment provides the runway to reach revenue milestones in Q2–Q3 2026.

## 5. Token Economics for Investors

### ALMAN Token Distribution (8B Total Supply)

All tokens were minted (created on-chain) at TGE on February 6, 2026. The distribution is on-chain and verifiable.

| Category | Amount | % | Recipient | Lock-up |
|:---------|:-------|:--|:----------|:--------|
| Foundation Reserve | 2,000,000,000 | 25.0% | Foundation Wallet | None |
| Community – Staking | 1,000,000,000 | 12.5% | ALMANStaking Contract | Released as rewards |
| Community – Mining | 800,000,000 | 10.0% | MiningPool Contract | Released via game claims |
| Community – DAO | 800,000,000 | 10.0% | DAO Reserve | Governance votes |
| Community – Airdrop | 600,000,000 | 7.5% | KindnessAirdrop Contract | Activity-based claims |
| Liquidity & Exchange | 1,200,000,000 | 15.0% | DEX Liquidity Pool + CEX (centralized exchanges) | None |
| Team & Advisors | 800,000,000 | 10.0% | TokenVesting Contract | 12-month cliff + 3-year linear |
| Kindness Grants | 800,000,000 | 10.0% | Grants Wallet | None |
| **Total** | **8,000,000,000** | **100%** | | |

### Investor Token Allocation

The investor receives ALMAN tokens from the Foundation Reserve at a steep discount:

| Investment | Token Amount | % of Supply | Implied FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) | Vesting (token release schedule) |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|:------------|:--------|
| $100,000 | 200,000,000 ALMAN | 2.5% | $4M | 6-month cliff + 2-year linear |

The investor's vesting is shorter than the team's (6-month vs. 12-month cliff, 2-year vs. 3-year duration), rewarding early risk.

### Token Value Drivers

1. **AI Hub Usage**: Premium model access requires ALMAN payment → buy pressure
2. **Staking Rewards**: 1B ALMAN in staking pool incentivizes long-term holding
3. **Governance**: DAO participation requires ALMAN staking → reduced circulating supply
4. **Game Mining**: 800M ALMAN released gradually via halving epochs → controlled inflation
5. **NFT Marketplace**: Transaction fees partially burned → deflationary pressure
6. **Kindness Airdrop**: 600M distributed to active community members → organic distribution

### Return Scenarios

| Timeline | Token Price | FDV | Investor Value (200M ALMAN) | Return |
|:---------|:-----------|:----|:---------------------------|:-------|
| TGE | $0.0005 | $4M | $100,000 | 1x |
| Year 1 | $0.001 | $8M | $200,000 | 2x |
| Year 2 | $0.005 | $40M | $1,000,000 | 10x |
| Year 3 | $0.01–$0.05 | $80M–$400M | $2M–$10M | 20x–100x |

**Comparable token performance at similar stages:**
- Akash Network ($AKT): Seed at ~$3M FDV → peaked at $1.5B+ (500x)
- Render ($RNDR): Seed at ~$50M FDV → peaked at $5B+ (100x)
- Helium ($HNT): Seed at ~$10M FDV → peaked at $5B+ (500x)

AlmaNEO's pre-money FDV of $4M offers asymmetric upside at the earliest possible entry point.

## 6. GAII as a Defensible Moat (Structural Competitive Advantage)

The Global AI Inequality Index is not just a social impact metric — it is a **proprietary data asset** with no direct competitor.

### Why GAII is Defensible

1. **First-Mover Advantage**: No other organization publishes a standardized AI inequality index. AlmaNEO has a 50-country head start.

2. **Network Effects**: As more countries and organizations contribute data, the index becomes more comprehensive and harder to replicate.

3. **Regulatory Demand**: The EU AI Act and global ESG requirements are creating mandatory demand for AI fairness metrics. GAII is positioned to become the standard reference.

4. **Partnership Leverage**: AI companies under public pressure to demonstrate inclusivity can partner with AlmaNEO for GAII certification — exchanging API credits for data and ethical credibility.

5. **Analog to Credit Ratings**: MSCI (ESG ratings) trades at $40B+. S&P Global (credit ratings) trades at $120B+. A specialized AI inequality index, even at 0.01% of that scale, represents significant value.

### GAII as a Business Asset

| Use Case | Customer | Revenue Model |
|:---------|:---------|:-------------|
| ESG Compliance | AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) | Annual licensing ($10K–$100K/year) |
| Policy Research | Governments, World Bank, UNDP | Report sponsorship ($5K–$50K) |
| Academic Citation | Universities, think tanks | Free (brand building) |
| Partnership Leverage | AI providers | API credits in exchange for GAII data |

---

## 10. Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|:-----|:-------|:------------|:-----------|
| **Regulatory** | Token classified as security in some jurisdictions | Medium | Legal opinion letter, SAFE structure, focus on utility |
| **Partnership** | AI companies may not engage | Medium | GAII creates genuine value proposition; start with CSR-focused companies (Google.org, Anthropic) |
| **Market Timing** | Crypto market downturn reduces token value | Medium | Revenue streams are fiat-denominated; token is utility, not speculation |
| **Key Person** | Heavy dependence on Ruca Lee for technical development | High | Accelerator programs provide mentorship; hiring CTO is a Year 1 priority |
| **Competition** | Larger player builds similar index | Low | 50-country head start; first-mover in GAII category; community moat |
| **Adoption** | Users in Global South may not adopt | Medium | Game and Kindness Protocol create non-financial engagement hooks |

---

## 11. Investment Terms

### Proposed Structure

| Term | Detail |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Instrument** | SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) + Token Warrant |
| **Investment Amount** | $100,000 |
| **Valuation Cap** | $4,000,000 (pre-money FDV) |
| **Token Price** | $0.0005 per ALMAN |
| **Token Allocation** | 200,000,000 ALMAN (2.5% of total supply) |
| **Token Vesting** | 6-month cliff + 2-year linear vesting |
| **Pro-rata Rights** | Right to participate in future funding rounds at same terms |
| **Information Rights** | Monthly progress updates, quarterly financial reports |
| **Board/Advisory** | Optional board observer seat or advisory role |

### Why This Valuation is Attractive

- **Asset value**: $500K–$800K already built → investor enters below replacement cost
- **Market timing**: Pre-mainnet, pre-revenue, pre-listing → earliest possible entry
- **Grant pipeline**: $500K+ in pending grant applications provide non-dilutive (no equity given up) funding runway
- **Team commitment**: Team tokens locked for 12-month cliff + 3-year vesting → full alignment
- **Upside**: Comparable DePIN (decentralized infrastructure)/data protocols reached $1B+ from similar starting points

|:---------|:----------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| **Conservative** | $0.0005 | TGE (Day 1) | DEX listing at entry price |
| **Base Case** | $0.0005 | Month 3–6 | Mainnet launch + first partnerships |
| **If Token Drops 50%** | $0.001 | Month 9–12 | AI Hub premium launch recovers price |

The investor's entry price of **$0.0005** is extremely low. Even in a bearish scenario, the break-even threshold is achievable within the first year through basic platform milestones.

### Three Scenarios — 3-Year Projection

#### Conservative Scenario
- Token grows modestly with platform usage
- Limited partnerships (1–2 AI companies)
- AI Hub reaches 10K users

| Year | Token Price | Portfolio Value | ROI |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------------|:----|
| 1 | $0.0008 | $160,000 | 1.6x |
| 2 | $0.002 | $400,000 | 4x |
| 3 | $0.005 | $1,000,000 | **10x** |

#### Base Case Scenario
- Active partnerships with 3–5 AI companies
- GAII adopted by international organizations
- AI Hub reaches 50K users, premium tier active

| Year | Token Price | Portfolio Value | ROI |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------------|:----|
| 1 | $0.001 | $200,000 | 2x |
| 2 | $0.005 | $1,000,000 | 10x |
| 3 | $0.02 | $4,000,000 | **40x** |

#### Optimistic Scenario
- GAII becomes the industry standard for AI equity measurement
- 10+ AI company partnerships, CEX listings
- AI Hub reaches 500K+ users, strong token utility

| Year | Token Price | Portfolio Value | ROI |
|:-----|:-----------|:---------------|:----|
| 1 | $0.002 | $400,000 | 4x |
| 2 | $0.01 | $2,000,000 | 20x |
| 3 | $0.05 | $10,000,000 | **100x** |

### What Drives Token Value at Each Stage

| Timeline | Milestone | Impact on Token Price |
|:---------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Month 1–3** | Mainnet + DEX listing | Initial price discovery, liquidity established |
| **Month 4–6** | First AI partnership + GAII v2.0 | Validation signal → 1.5–2x from entry |
| **Month 7–12** | AI Hub premium (ALMAN payments) + CEX listing | Buy pressure from utility → 2–4x |
| **Year 2** | Multiple partnerships + Kindness Expo + 50K users | Network effects → 5–20x |
| **Year 3** | GAII industry standard + 500K users + global expansion | Category leadership → 20–100x |

### Comparison with Similar Early-Stage Investments

| Project | Seed FDV | Peak FDV | Seed→Peak Multiple | AlmaNEO Equivalent |
|:--------|:---------|:---------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| Akash ($AKT) | ~$3M | $1.5B+ | **500x** | $100K → $50M |
| Render ($RNDR) | ~$50M | $5B+ | **100x** | $100K → $10M |
| Helium ($HNT) | ~$10M | $5B+ | **500x** | $100K → $50M |
| Filecoin ($FIL) | ~$50M | $12B+ | **240x** | $100K → $24M |
| **AlmaNEO** | **$4M** | **TBD** | **TBD** | **$100K → ?** |

AlmaNEO's FDV at entry ($4M) is lower than all comparable projects at their seed stage, providing a wider margin of safety and greater upside potential.

### Summary: Why $100K Now

| Factor | Detail |
|:-------|:-------|
| **Entry Price** | $0.0005/ALMAN — lowest possible price before public listing |
| **Break-Even** | Achievable at TGE or within first 6 months |
| **Conservative 3-Year** | 10x return ($100K → $1M) |
| **Base Case 3-Year** | 40x return ($100K → $4M) |
| **Optimistic 3-Year** | 100x return ($100K → $10M) |
| **Downside Protection** | The platform's rebuild cost alone exceeds $500K — 5x the investment amount in tangible assets already built. An additional $500K+ in grant applications are in progress, none of which dilute investor equity. Team tokens are locked for 3 years, structurally ensuring long-term founder commitment. |

**The risk-reward structure of this investment is fundamentally asymmetric.** Downside is bounded by existing built assets and non-dilutive grant funding, while upside scales with the growth of AI equity measurement — a market with no established leader.

## Appendix B: GAII Methodology Summary

**Global AI Inequality Index (GAII)** measures the gap between AI haves and have-nots using four weighted indicators:

| Indicator | Weight | Measures |
|:----------|:-------|:---------|
| Access | 40% | AI adoption rate, internet penetration, mobile connectivity, infrastructure |
| Affordability | 30% | AI cost-to-income ratio, free service availability, purchasing power |
| Language | 20% | Local language AI support, translation quality, content availability |
| Skill | 10% | AI literacy, STEM education, digital competency |

**Formula:** `GAII = 100 - (0.4 × Access + 0.3 × Affordability + 0.2 × Language + 0.1 × Skill)`

**Score interpretation:**
- 0–25: Low inequality (strong AI ecosystem)
- 26–50: Moderate inequality
- 51–75: High inequality
- 76–100: Critical inequality

**Data Sources:** Microsoft Global AI Adoption Report, World Bank Development Indicators, ITU ICT Statistics, UNESCO Education Data

**Current Coverage:** 50 countries across 10 regions
**Roadmap:** 100 countries by Q3 2026, 150+ by Q4 2026
