## 2. Problem Statement: Invisible Barriers

### In the AI Era, Who Owns Intelligence?

In 2024, humanity has acquired the most powerful tool in history. AI writes, codes, diagnoses medical conditions, and interprets laws. The gap between those who have these tools and those who do not is faster and deeper than any previous technological revolution.

But one question remains:

> **"Who owns this powerful intelligence?"**

### 2.1 AI Inequality: A New Form of Colonialism

Just as the previous industrial revolution brought about inequality in physical labor, the AI revolution is creating **inequality in 'thinking and intelligence'**.

**Real-World Numbers:**

| Indicators | Current Status |
|------|------|
| AI Computational Resource Concentration | The Top 1% of Companies Own Over 90% of Global GPUs |
| AI Service Costs | $20 per month (Youth in developed countries: 4 cups of coffee / Youth in the Global South: 10-30% of monthly living expenses) |
| AI startup investment | The US and China account for over 80% of global investment |
| Language bias | More than 90% of the training data for major AI models is in English |

Universities in developed countries use AI to complete assignments, learn coding, and test startup ideas. At the same time, college students in developing countries are labeling the data needed to build that AI for a few dollars an hour.

**This is the true face of 21st-century digital colonialism.**

### 2.2 Monetization of Intelligence: The Collapsing Ladder of Opportunity

Education was a ladder of social mobility. Society was sustained by the belief that even children from poor families could achieve a better life if they studied hard.

But now, that ladder is shaky.

**Scenario: A Day in the Life of Two Young People**

| Category | 🇺🇸 Developed Country Youth A | 🌍 Global South Youth B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morning** | Editing resume with ChatGPT | Exceeding daily limit on free version AI |
| **Afternoon** | Completing coding project with Copilot | Only basic searches possible with slow internet |
| **Evening** | Learning a new language with an AI tutor | Starting a side hustle as a data labeler for an AI company |

How much wider will the competitiveness gap between the two young people be in a year?
Will this gap be recoverable in five years?

**The moment intelligence becomes monetized, equality of opportunity becomes a myth.**

### 2.3 Generational Conflict: Wealth in the Older Generation, Where Are the Opportunities?

Most of the world's wealth is concentrated in the older generation. This may be a natural phenomenon. The problem is that AI **accelerates** this imbalance.

The AI Paradox:

- The most creative potential for AI lies with the **young generation**
- Capital to purchase AI is concentrated among the **older generation**
- Consequently, AI provides even more leverage to existing wealth holders.

Young people are worried about their jobs being replaced by AI, while simultaneously being denied the opportunity to utilize AI. This double marginalization is deepening intergenerational conflict worldwide.

### 2.4 Human Alienation: What Disappears in the Shadow of Efficiency

AI maximizes efficiency: faster, more accurately, and cheaper.

However, some values are being pushed aside under the logic of efficiency:

- **Empathy**: Understanding emotions takes time
- **Solidarity**: Helping others is inefficient
- **Relationships**: True bonds cannot be measured

"In an era where AI replaces human work, how will humans prove their worth?"

We must answer this question. Otherwise, a paradoxical future will arrive in which technology advances but humans are marginalized.

### The Core of the Problem

> ### ⚠️ The Core of the Problem
>
> 1. **Capital monopolizes intelligence.**
> 2. Inequality of intelligence leads to **inequality of opportunity.**
> 3. Inequality of opportunity leads to **loss of hope.**
> 4. As the number of young people who lose hope increases, **the future of the planet becomes bleak.**

**AlmaNEO was born to break this chain.**
