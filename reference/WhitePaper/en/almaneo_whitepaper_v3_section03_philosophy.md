## 3. Our Philosophy: What We Believe

### Technology is a tool. Humans are the subject.

AlmaNEO is not a simple token project. We offer a single answer to the question of how humans should live in the AI era.

### 3.1 Jeong (情): From Korea to the World

In Korea, there is a word called "Jeong (情)".

Jeong is not simply kindness. It is a deep bond built over time, a heart that connects without words, and a warmth that cannot be ignored even when loss occurs. Jeong cannot be explained by efficiency. It cannot be measured by calculations. However, a relationship based on Jeong is stronger than any contract.

AI seeks to optimize everything: faster, cheaper, and more efficiently. However, Jeong is not an object of optimization. Jeong takes time. Jeong is sometimes inefficient. Therefore, Jeong is a uniquely human value that AI cannot replace.

### 3.2 Three Core Principles

#### Principle 1: People, Not Politics

We don't look at countries. We look at people.

A person's worth is not determined by where they were born or what government they live under. A young person in Nigeria, a young person in Vietnam, a young person in Brazil—they all deserve the same dream.

AlmaNEO is not bound by political ideology or national borders. Our standard is simple:

> "Does this person want a better future?"**

If so, we are on their side.

#### Principle 2: Individuals, Not Countries

The grand system sees individuals as numbers. GDP, unemployment rates, growth rates—the lives of individuals are invisible in these statistics.

But statistics miss something. A young man in Lagos learning to code overnight, a college student in Manila working a side job to support his family, a graduate from Bogota dreaming of opening a small business—their efforts and hopes cannot be reduced to numbers.

**AlmaNEO sees individuals, not statistics. It helps people, not systems.**

#### Principle 3: Technology is a tool, humans are the subject

No matter how advanced AI becomes, the final decision must be made by humans.

Technology should not dominate humans, but humans should be the subjects of technology. AlmaNEO does not deify AI. AI is simply a powerful tool. It is up to us humans to decide how to use it.

### 3.3 A World Where Kindness Becomes Value

In the current economic system, kindness is not rewarded.

You could earn money by helping someone. You could monopolize knowledge instead of sharing it. You could compete instead of uniting. Kind people often lose out.

**AlmaNEO turns this equation on its head.**

| Classification | Existing System | AlmaNEO System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Action and Result** | Monopoly → Profit <br>Sharing → Loss | Sharing → Increased Kindness Score → More Opportunities |
| **Direction** | Competition → Success <br>Solidarity → Inefficiency | Solidarity → Accumulation of Trust Assets → Increased Influence within the Ecosystem <br>Kindness → On-chain Record → Real Rewards |

The more you help others, share knowledge, and contribute to the community, the more your value increases. This is the new economy designed by AlmaNEO.

### 3.4 The Future We Dream of

Ten years from now, we envision a world like this:

- A young Nigerian developer freely uses AI tools to launch a startup that solves African agricultural problems.
- A Vietnamese university student connects with a young Brazilian using Kindness Score and starts a business together.
- The Kindness Expo, which began in the DMZ, travels to underprivileged regions around the world, spreading hope.
- "What is your Kindness Score?" becomes a more important question than "What is your education?"

**Is this just a pipe dream?**

When the internet first emerged, a world with a global connection was a distant dream. When Bitcoin first emerged, a stateless currency seemed impossible.

Making the seemingly impossible possible—that's the power of technology. And guiding that technology in the right direction—that's the role of humans.

### Our Manifesto

> **"We plant warm affection on cold code."**
>
> The ultimate goal of technology lies in humanity.
> The ultimate goal of efficiency lies in empathy. At the end of competition, there must be solidarity.

AlmaNEO will embody this belief in code,
realize it with tokens,
and prove it through the community.
