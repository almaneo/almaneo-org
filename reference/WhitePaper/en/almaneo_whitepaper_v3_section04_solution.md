## 4. Solution: AlmaNEO Ecosystem

### A New World Built on Three Pillars

AlmaNEO builds three core components to address AI inequality. Each component operates independently, yet interconnects to form a single ecosystem.

**AlmaNEO Ecosystem Structure:**

| Components | Roles | Connections |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| **GAII** | Measurement | Interconnection with AI Hub and Kindness Protocol |
| **AI Hub** | Provisioning | Interconnection with GAII and Kindness Protocol |
| **Kindness Protocol** | Rewards | Interconnection with GAII and AI Hub |

All three components are connected by **ALMAN TOKEN** (a medium of value).

### 4.1 GAII (Global AI Inequality Index)

#### If you can't measure it, you can't improve it

GAII is a transparent index that measures and discloses the current state of AI inequality around the world in real time.

#### Measurement Items

| Category | Detailed Indicators |
|----------|----------|
| **Accessibility** | Per capita AI service usage by country, ratio of AI subscription fees to average income |
| **Infrastructure** | GPU computing resource share by country, data center distribution |
| **Bias** | Language-based performance gaps in AI models, cultural bias |
| **Opportunity** | Distribution of AI-related jobs, investment rate in AI startups |

#### Role of GAII

**1. Status Visualization**
- Real-time visibility of AI inequality across the globe through a dashboard.
- Visualization of data by country, region, and age.

**2. Urging Corporate Responsibility**
- Publicly discuss the social responsibility of companies monopolizing AI resources
- Grant an "Ethical AI Label" to companies that contribute to reducing inequality

**3. Providing Policy Basis**
- Provide objective data to international organizations and governments for AI policymaking
- Utilize as a new indicator for ESG evaluations

#### Openness Principle

All GAII data is recorded on-chain and verifiable by anyone. We do not monopolize data. To address inequality, we must first transparently expose it.

### 4.3 Kindness Protocol

#### Prove and reward kindness

The Kindness Protocol is the core of the AlmaNEO ecosystem. Beyond simply providing AI, it encourages and rewards "humane use."

#### Proof of Humanity: Proof of Humanity

Existing blockchain consensus methods:
- Proof of Work: Prove computational power
- Proof of Stake: Prove capital

AlmaNEO's consensus method:
- **Proof of Humanity**: Prove humanity

**"Prove not how much you have, but how much you share."**

#### Kindness Score: Kindness Score

Quantifies the good deeds that occur within the community.

**How to earn points:**

| Activity | Description | Score example |
|------|------|----------|
| **Mentoring** | Helping other users learn | +10~50 |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Creating tutorials and guides | +20~100 |
| **Translation Contribution** | Participating in localizing AI models | +15~80 |
| **Community Support** | Answering questions and helping with troubleshooting | +5~30 |
| **Social Contribution** | Solving local problems using AI | +50~200 |

#### Verification System: Trustworthy Kindness

Multi-layer verification to prevent manipulation of kindness scores:

| Steps | Process | Contents |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | **Activity Record** | Users submit proof of their kindness activities |
| **Step 2** | **Peer Review** | Community members verify the authenticity of activities |
| **Step 3** | **On-chain Record** | Verified activity is permanently recorded as **SBT** (Soulbound Token) |
| **Security** | **ZKP implementation** | Privacy protection with zero-knowledge proof |

#### Benefits of Kindness Score

Users with a high Kindness Score:

- **More AI Resources**: Priority access to advanced models, additional free credits
- **Governance Influence**: Higher weighting in DAO voting
- **Kindness Expo Participation**: Priority invitations to annual global events
- **Networking Opportunities**: Connect with Kindness leaders around the world

#### Jeong-SBT: Non-transferable Soul Token

Kindness Score is recorded as **Jeong-SBT (Jeong Soulbound Token)**.

**SBT Features:**
- Non-transferable: Kindness cannot be bought or sold.
- Permanent Record: Your contributions remain on the blockchain forever.
- Identity Verification: A New ID Card for the AI Era

> *"In the AlmaNEO ecosystem, Jeong-SBT demonstrates who you are. Not your academic background or wealth, but how kind you are."*

### Synergy of Three Pillars

GAII, AI Hub, and Kindness Protocol are not independent. They work together to create a virtuous cycle.

**Virtuous Cycle Process:**

1. **GAII** measures inequality.
2. **AI Hub** allocates resources to underserved areas.
3. **Kindness Protocol** encourages proper use.
4. Kind users help others.
5. More people benefit from AI.
6. **GAII Index** improves.
7. *(Circle back to 1)*

**This is the new AI economy designed by AlmaNEO.**
