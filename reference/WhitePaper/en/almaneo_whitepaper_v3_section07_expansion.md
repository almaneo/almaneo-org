## 7. Ecosystem Expansion

### AlmaNEO is not a platform, but a seed

AlmaNEO's ultimate goal is not to operate a single service. We aim to create a foundation where young people around the world can create value on their own. We envision a virtuous cycle where numerous projects will sprout within the AlmaNEO ecosystem, and these projects will in turn enrich the ecosystem.

Our goal is to grow the ecosystem to a point where it can run on its own, and then fully hand it over to the community. Just as parents raise their children to become independent, AlmaNEO will nurture the ecosystem and set it free.
