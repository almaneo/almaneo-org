## 11. Team & Advisors

### Who We Are

The AlmaNEO team values authenticity over flashy resumes. We don't come from large corporations. We didn't start with the backing of famous investors. We are ordinary, yet passionate people who want to stand on the side of those who are marginalized in the age of AI.

### 11.1 Team Philosophy

#### Why We Start Anonymously

The AlmaNEO founding team initially operates anonymously or under pseudonyms.

**Reason:**
- **Project-centered**: We want to be evaluated based on the value of the project, not on individual reputation.
- **Fair Start**: We don't rely on academic background, career experience, or connections.
- **Safety**: We minimize unnecessary personal risks in the early stages.

**Promise:**
- As the project stabilizes and trustworthy team members are secured, we will gradually disclose real names.
- Even before real names are disclosed, all decisions and financial use will be transparently recorded.
- The community can judge a team by its actions.
