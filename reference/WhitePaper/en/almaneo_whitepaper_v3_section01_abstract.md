# AlmaNEO (ALMAN) Whitepaper v3.0

**"Democratizing Intelligence, Cultivating Humanity"**

## 1. Abstract

### A New Evolutionary Leap for Humanity

Artificial intelligence is the most powerful tool in human history. However, this tool is currently concentrated in the hands of a few.

Over 90% of the world's AI computing resources are monopolized by the top 1% of companies and countries. A $20 monthly subscription fee might cost a few cups of coffee for a young person in developed countries, but it represents a significant portion of a young person's monthly living expenses in the Global South. The moment intelligence becomes monetized, the ladder of opportunity collapses.

**AlmaNEO (ALMAN)** is the answer to this problem.

We are redeploying the AI infrastructure monopolized by large capitalists as a public good for all of humanity. AlmaNEO is a token for the world's 8 billion people and a **"lifeboat of intelligence"** that guarantees free AI access to marginalized young people.

But we don't stop at simply distributing technology.

As AI becomes more sophisticated, human warmth becomes increasingly valuable. AlmaNEO, inspired by Korea's culture of "jeong" (情), is building a new economic system that values acts of helping others and showing solidarity. A world where kindness becomes an asset—that's the future AlmaNEO envisions.

### Vision

> *"Cold Code, Warm Soul"*
>
> By adding a warm soul to cold code,
> we create a world where technology does not alienate humans,
> but rather perfects them.

AlmaNEO goes beyond currency and will become the **identity card** of "kind friends" who have not lost their humanity in the AI era.
