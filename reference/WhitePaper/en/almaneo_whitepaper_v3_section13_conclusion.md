### Why AlmaNEO Now?

We stand in the midst of the most powerful technological revolution in human history.

Artificial intelligence is amplifying human capabilities and making the impossible possible. However, these amazing tools are currently concentrated in the hands of a few. The gap between those with access and those without is widening every day.

**AlmaNEO is our answer to this trend.**

### The World We Want to Create

> **The World We Want to Create**
>
> A young man in Nigeria uses the same AI as a young man in Seoul.
>
> Kind people have more opportunities.
>
> Technology connects people, not alienates them.
>
> 'Emotion' becomes code, and trust becomes currency.

This may sound like a far-fetched dream. But all great changes began with seemingly impossible dreams.

8 billion tokens for 8 billion people.
