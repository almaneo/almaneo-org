## 9. Governance & Foundation

### Power Must Be Decentralized

AlmaNEO is not a project dominated by any individual or organization. We designed decentralized governance from the ground up, empowering the community to determine its own future.

---

### 9.1 Governance Philosophy

#### Three Principles

| Principles | Description |
|------|------|
| **Transparency** | All decision-making processes and financial usage details are publicly available on-chain |
| **Participation** | Any token holder can propose, vote, and participate in decisions |
| **Kindness Weighting** | The voice of those who contribute more is stronger than those who simply have more |

---

### 9.2 DAO Structure

The AlmaNEO DAO gathers the collective intelligence of the community to determine the direction of the project.

### AlmaNEO DAO Structure

**AlmaNEO DAO Structure:**

| Composition | Roles | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Token Holders** | Entire Community | Proposal Voting Rights, Kindness-Weighted Voting, Council Election |
| **Council** | Council (9 members) | Urgent Agenda Handling, Proposal Pre-Review |
| **Foundation** | Foundation | Daily Operations, Legal Representative, DAO Decision Execution |

**Relationship:** Token Holders Elect the Council → Council Cooperates with the Foundation → Foundation Supports/Executes Holders

---

### 9.3 Voting Mechanism

#### Kindness-Weighted Voting

AlmaNEO's voting system is not simply "1 Token = 1 Vote."

```
Voting Power = √(Tokens Held) × Kindness Score Multiplier
```

| Kindness Score | Multiplier |
|----------------|------|
| 0 - 100 | 1.0x |
| 101 - 500 | 1.5x |
| 501 - 1000 | 2.0x |
| 1001+ | 2.5x |

**What this system means:**
- Limits the monopoly power of whales (large holders)
- Amplifies the voices of active community contributors
- A structure where kindness equals influence

#### Proposal Types

| Type | Quorum | Passing Requirements | Example |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| **General Proposal** | 5% | Majority | Small Budget Use, Partnership |
| **Important Proposal** | 15% | 2/3rds | Expo Hosting, Large Grants |
| **Constitutional Amendment** | 30% | 3/4ths | Token Economy Changes, Governance Structure Changes |

---

### 9.4 AlmaNEO Foundation

The Foundation is the legal entity that enforces the DAO's decisions in the real world.

#### Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|------|
| **Legal Representative** | Contract Execution, Partnerships, Regulatory Response |
| **Daily Operations** | Development Team Management, Infrastructure Operations |
| **DAO Execution** | Execution of Community Decisions |
| **Asset Management** | Foundation Reserve Management (Multi-Signature) |

#### Commitment to Transparency

- **Quarterly Financial Reports** Disclosure
- **All Expenditures** Recorded On-Chain
- **Annual External Audit** Conducted
- **Council Oversight** Accepted

#### Foundation Establishment Plan

The location of the Foundation will be determined by considering the following factors:

| Factors Considered | Description |
|----------|------|
| **DAO-Friendly Laws** | Jurisdictions that Legally Recognize DAO Activities |
| **Tax Efficiency** | Taxation Appropriate for Nonprofit Activities |
| **Ease of Operation** | Possibility of Remote Establishment/Operation |
| **Reputation** | A Legitimate Innovation Zone, Not a Regulatory Avoidance Zone |

> *The specific establishment location will be finalized and announced after legal review.*

### 9.5 Gradual Decentralization

AlmaNEO does not pursue complete decentralization from the outset. Rapid decentralization may actually put the project at risk.

### Gradual Decentralization Roadmap

| Phase | Period | Features | Key Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | 2025-2026 | Foundation-led | Establish core infrastructure, form an initial community, and the Foundation makes major decisions |
| **Phase 2** | 2026-2027 | Joint Governance | Begins Council elections, DAO voting on major agenda items, and gradual transfer of authority to the Foundation |
| **Phase 3** | 2027-2028 | DAO-led | Most decisions are made in the DAO, with the Foundation transitioning to the executive body |
| **Phase 4** | 2028+ | Fully decentralized | Foundation minimized or dissolved, smart contract-based automated operation, full community autonomy |

---

### 9.6 Safeguards

#### Emergency Pause

In the event of a serious security threat or bug, the protocol can be temporarily suspended by a majority vote of the Council (5/9).

The protocol will be resumed or resolved through a DAO vote within 48 hours of the suspension.

#### Multi-Sig

Foundation assets are managed through a multi-signature wallet.

| Purpose | Signature Requirements |
|------|----------|
| Daily operating expenses | 3/5 signatures |
| Large expenditures | 5/7 signatures |
| Emergency fund | 7/9 signatures + DAO vote |

#### Timelock

Major smart contract changes are subject to a 48-hour timelock, ensuring the community has time to review and object.

### Ultimate Goal of Governance

> "Even if the AlmaNEO Foundation disappears one day, the AlmaNEO ecosystem must continue to function. Our success hinges on us becoming obsolete."*
